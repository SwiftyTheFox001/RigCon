This project is heavily based on [DigiRig-mobile](https://github.com/softcomplex/Digirig-Mobile) (GNU GPL v3) to provide an already established audio, ptt and uart interface for digital modes for ham radio. The CM108 was replaced with an CM108B and the 2-port USB controller was replaced with a 4-port USB controller to accomodate the additional external USB Port.# RigCon
